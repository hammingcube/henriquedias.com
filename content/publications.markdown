[![Aprenda a Programar: o e-book gratuito e essencial](/images/aprendaaprogramar.jpg)](/general/aprenda-a-programar-o-e-book-gratuito-e-essencial/)

**Aprenda a Programar** is an ebook created by me with the help of the Pplware community. It allows the reader to learn how to program. It doesn't only teaches how to use the C language, but how to program.

[**Pplware**](http://pplware.com) is a portuguese project which is mainly based on technology news and tutorials. But it also has a lot of other strands. I write news and articles about programming for Pplware.

**COXPE - Code Experts** was a blog where I posted a lot of tutorials about programming. In the end it merged with my personal website you're seeing now.
